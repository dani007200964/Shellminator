Unit Test:
* Shellminator-Styles.cpp mostly covered.
* A lot of protection is added( wrong buffer, wrong pointer... )

Buffering option:
* From now buffering is a runtime option.
* The buffer has to be initialized in the init section.
* The size of the buffer is configurable.
* It uses malloc, but only once, when it is initialized.
* If memory allocation fails, it will use the simple, non-buffered solution.
* ShellminatorBufferedPrinter::printf now returns an int, like it should.
* acceleratorBuffer and acceleratorBufferPtr is removed from the Shellminator object.
