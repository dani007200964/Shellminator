This section is created for people, who love adventures and wants to understand and develop this project.
In the past years this project become relatively big. For this reason it has multiple source files.
I wanted to make it as platform independent as possible, this is why I needed to create an automated build and
test system. It is not trivial to use, but I will try to describe the most important steps as much as I can.
