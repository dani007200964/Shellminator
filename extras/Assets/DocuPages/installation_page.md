## Arduino Installation

Let's start with the installation guide for the Arduino environment, as we believe this is the simplest one of all. First, you will need the
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). This software is the heart of the Arduino ecosystem. Next, you'll need an Arduino board that has enough resources to meet your goals.

To help you find the most suitable board, we've created a table for you to easily choose one.

If you're just getting acquainted with this software, we recommend choosing a slightly more modern microcontroller, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico or the ESP32. We suggest this because these platforms have much more memory than, for example, an older Arduino Nano. This extra memory allows you to try out all the functions without needing to optimize right away. We're offering this friendly advice to help you avoid any additional distractions while you're learning.

Once you've installed the Arduino IDE, the next task is to install Shellminator. You can find detailed instructions
[here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-installing-a-library/).
Please make sure to always strive for using the latest version to ensure you have the most stable version on your computer.
