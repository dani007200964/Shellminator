### Useful Tips for Getting Started  

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a **terminal emulator** on your computer. Here are our recommendations:  

- **Windows:** We suggest using **PuTTY** because itâ€™s free and has worked with all features so far. You can use it for both **TCP** and **serial port** connections.  
- **macOS & Linux:** The built-in terminal emulators usually come with the necessary tools pre-installed.  
  - To connect via **serial port**, use:  
    ```sh
    screen PORT PORT_SPEED
    ```  
    Example:  
    ```sh
    screen /dev/ttyS0 115200
    ```  
  - To connect via **TCP**, use:  
    ```sh
    telnet IP PORT
    ```  
    Example:  
    ```sh
    telnet 192.168.0.160 23
    ```

- **Linux:** If these commands donâ€™t work, the required packages might not be installed. You can fix this by running:  
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install telnet screen
  ```

### Missing Characters or Emojis on Linux?  

On Linux, you might run into a weird issue where **some characters donâ€™t display correctly** because theyâ€™re missing from the UTF-8 table. This can make things like emojis look strange.  

If you're using **Ubuntu**, this usually isnâ€™t a problem. However, on systems like **Raspberry Pi OS**, emojis are often missing by default.  

If you need to install them, [this guide](https://oorkan.medium.com/emojifying-your-linux-terminal-9a5c1e8f6b3c) can help you get everything set up! ðŸ˜Š
