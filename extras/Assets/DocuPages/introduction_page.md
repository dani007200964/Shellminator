        <p>Shellminator is an innovative terminal interface specially designed for embedded devices. Written in C++, it is fully compatible with the Arduino development environment. We absolutely love creative minds, so we've made sure that you can easily and quickly build a versatile, feature-rich command line for your next amazing project.

## Just a few lines of code and it is done!

```cpp
#include "Shellminator.hpp"

// Create a Shellminator object, and initialize it to use Serial
Shellminator shell( &Serial );

// System init section.
void setup(){
    Serial.begin(115200);

    // Clear the terminal
    shell.clear();

    // Initialize shell object.
    shell.begin( "arnold" );
}

// Infinite loop.
void loop(){
    // Process the new data.
    shell.update();
}
```

        <p>Right? It doesn't seem that complicated, does it? It was very important to us to keep things simple if that's what you prefer. After all, if you don't appreciate the small things, you don't deserve the big ones. But of course, if you love taking things to a more complex level, the sky's the limit!

## But isn't the command line a bit outdated?

        <p>That's a completely valid question in a world where almost any microcontroller rolling off the production line can drive a display. However, as IoT continues to grow, so do the number of devices that don't have any kind of user interface, except maybe a USB port for configuration.

    <div>
        <p>There are also situations where it's physically impossible for someone to be next to the device. Just think about the Mars rover â€“ no one is standing next to it all day because it would be quite a long commute if that were someone's job!

        <p>Another important aspect to consider with a device that has a command line interface is the ability to interactively manipulate the hardware without reprogramming it. Imagine how awesome that is! If you set up such a system smartly, you can adjust GPIO pins, request and read data from sensors, take measurements with the ADC with just a few keystrokes.

        <p>Just imagine how much easier it is to debug a system this way. You can not only control it but also diagnose issues. Anyone who has ever built a robot knows that unexpected things always pop up in the field. Sometimes it's funny, but other times it can make you want to cry.
