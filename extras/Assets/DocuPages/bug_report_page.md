@page bug_report_page Bug Report

Bugs can happen in any product, and software is no exception. If you come across an issue, it's best to report it as soon as possible so we can fix it. The first step is to create a new issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dani007200964/Shellminator/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

<div style="display:flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
        <p>When filling out the issue description, try to be as detailed as possible. The more relevant information you provide, the faster and more efficiently we can investigate and resolve the problem. You don’t need to share your entire project’s source code—just narrow it down to the part that’s causing the issue. If you can include a minimal code snippet that reproduces the problem, that would be incredibly helpful!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="width:250px; height:250px; margin-right: 20px;">
        <lottie-player src="Lady-bug.json" background="transparent" speed="1" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" direction="1" playMode="normal" loop autoplay></lottie-player>
    </div>
</div>
\endhtmlonly

Also, don’t forget to mention your setup: which environment you're working in, what microcontroller you’re using, and which compiler you’re working with. Try to document the issue in a way that would make it easy for someone else (or even yourself, later) to reproduce it based on your description.

Thanks for helping us improve!
